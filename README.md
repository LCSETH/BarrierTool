## Algorithm

BarrierTool implements theoretical results developed by the Haller Group at ETH Zurich. More specifically, the code presented here provides a fully automated identification of black-hole eddies [1], diffusive transport barriers [2], diffusive vortex boundaries [3] and objective Eulerian Coherent Structures [4] in an objective (observer-independent) fashion. You may find more details about the underlying algorithm [5] as well as instructions on how to navigate through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or use the scripts in the file "MANUAL.pdf" contained in the repository.
